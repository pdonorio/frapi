Flask (+restful plugin) RethinkDB API

This project has been developed as a personal need.
It also worked as a good exercise in my way of learning python
and many other interesting technologies and protocol.

Those have been the main objectives:

* **Virtualization**: Dockerfiles (docker >= 1.3) to create containers
* **Security**: Docker script to launch the cluster (data + rethinkdb with auth key + flask connecting with the key)
* **Editor**: Learn a better editor. Sublime Text 3 (together with Vintageous) seems to cover all my need now.
* **AutoDocs**: Script to generate inside python code the necessary documentation out of internal comments
* **Snippets**: Sublime snipcode to write class and functions to help writing comments for the previous objective
* **Schema**: map rethink table (ORM) and flask api resource to a class model
* **API auth**: users profiling and grouping (RBAC)
